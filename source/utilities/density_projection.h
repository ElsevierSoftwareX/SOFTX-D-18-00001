    @brief Functionality for preparing a starting guess density matrix
    given a previous density matrix. The old density is read from
    file, and a projection between the basis sets is performed.

    The projection is done as follows:
    First, a matrix R is computed. 
    R is the overlap matrix between the two basis sets.
    Then RT * P * R is computed, where P is the starting guess density matrix
    read from file.
    To get a final projected density one could then multiply by S_inv from
    both sides, but to prepare for purification the matrix S*D*S is needed,
    so we skip multiplication by S_inv since it will anyway be cancelled out.

    @param densityMatrixList pointers to one or two empty matrices that will 
    contain the result.
    Purification is always run after the projection.
